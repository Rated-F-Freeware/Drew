Hi everyone! 
I'm Drew, I've worked on several projects during my time in College, most notable project was Nasa Ascend, also I 
helped train and manage a team. We build a payload and streamed a video from the payload down to an atenna on the ground.

I specalize in programming and have several languages under my belt. My all time favorite is C++, I've done several 
personal projects with it. I have also learned python for my time with Nasa Ascend. I'm self taught in the ways of Java.

I also enjoy watching some One Piece while programming. It's my pride and joy. Currently creating some projects that'll 
be open to the public. Hopefully some people will find some use for them like I do.
